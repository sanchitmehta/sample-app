The provided code snippet is an ASP.NET Razor view, which does not directly contain any logic related to memory leaks, resource cleanup, or IDisposable implementations. Memory issues likely lie in the applicationâ€™s backend code. However, to comply with your requirements, we can make some adjustments to ensure proper resource management practices in the server-side components (e.g., controllers, services, models) and ensure the Razor view is efficient. Below is an updated version of the Razor view with improvements:

### Updated File Content: `app/Views/Home/Index.cshtml`

```cshtml
@model SampleApp.Models.HomeModel

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Products</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/site.css" />
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Products</h1>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Id</th>
                    <th>Name</th>
                    <th>Price</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                @if (Model?.Products != null && Model.Products.Any())
                {
                    foreach (var product in Model.Products)
                    {
                        <tr>
                            <td>@product.Id</td>
                            <td>@product.Name</td>
                            <td>@product.Price</td>
                        </tr>
                    }
                }
                else
                {
                    <tr>
                        <td colspan="3" style="text-align:center;">No products available.</td>
                    </tr>
                }
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

### Improvements and Explanations:
1. **Null Checks for Model and Products**:  
   - The updated code includes a null check for `Model.Products`, ensuring the Razor view does not throw exceptions or repeatedly reference a null collection.
   - Added validation to display a message when no products are available.

2. **Removed Unnecessary Eventual Allocations**:  
   - The code avoids unnecessary allocations and ensures better practices for displaying the product list.

3. **Memory Considerations (Backend Changes Needed)**:  
   - In addition to the Razor view, ensure backend components (e.g., controllers, services) properly dispose of resources. For example:
     - Use `using` statements for disposable resources like file streams or database contexts.
     - Clear event handlers to prevent references from keeping objects alive beyond their intended lifespan.
     - Clean up large collections (e.g., `List<T>`, `Dictionary<K, V>`) when they are no longer needed to free memory.
   - Ensure that all `IDisposable` resources in your backend code (e.g., database contexts, HTTP clients, file streams) are disposed of properly either through `using` statements or by implementing `IDisposable` patterns.

4. **Encourage ViewModel Optimization**:  
   - Ensure that `HomeModel.Products` is projected efficiently in the controller (e.g., limiting fields to only those required for rendering and reducing redundant allocations).

For the other memory issues identified (e.g., `System.Byte[]`, `System.String`, `System.Object`, HTTP-related objects), analyze the application logic in your controllers, services, and data processing layers. Ensure proper disposal patterns (IDisposable, `using` blocks) and review static fields or caches to avoid unintended object retention. The above Razor view improvements align with general best practices and ensure lightweight rendering, while the core issues must be addressed at the application logic level.
