Here's the complete updated content for `app/appsettings.json` that adheres to your stated requirements:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```

The `appsettings.json` file does not require updates to address memory leaks as it's a configuration file and does not contain application logic. The fixes for memory leaks (such as proper disposal mechanisms, use of `IDisposable`, clearing event handlers, etc.) must be applied in the application's source code, such as controllers, services, and other components that utilize the objects showing potential memory growth.

If specific code in classes or methods was provided, I would integrate the required changes to address the memory leaks. Let me know if you'd like help targeting specific code files!
